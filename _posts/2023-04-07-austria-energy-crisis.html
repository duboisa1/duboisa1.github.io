<p>Throughout 2022, the Austrian government implemented measures to counter energy-driven inflation by reducing the costs borne by households and companies. These measures mostly included direct consumer payments, energy tax deductions, and energy price caps. These measures allowed for the alleviation of the burden of price increases but had a significant impact on the country's finances, costing approximately 21.3 billion euros or 5.3% of Austria's GDP <a href="#source1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>To compensate for these costs, the Austrian government introduced a proposal on 18 November 2022 imposing windfall taxes on energy companies. While these new measures do not directly protect consumers, they are necessary to finance other protective measures. According to Finance Minister Magnus Brunner, they should raise between 2 and 4 billion euros, which will be invested 1:1 in support measures. Moreover, they are a way to promote fairness in this crisis. Many consider the exceptional profits obtained by energy companies unjust and believe they should be redistributed. The Austrian Vice-Chancellor agreed with this view, calling these taxes a ‘war dividend’ <a href="#source2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>These new taxes are twofold, differentiating between oil and gas companies on the one hand and electricity companies on the other hand. For the former, all profits 20% above the average of the past four years will be taxed up to 40%. This percentage will decrease to 33% if companies prove they are investing in the energy transition. For power companies, the tax will not apply to excess profits but to revenues above 140€/MWh. As in the previous case, if investments in the energy transition can be proven, this ceiling is relaxed and increased to 180€/MWh. In both cases, 90% of excess revenues will be retained <a href="#source3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Taxing windfall profits has been heavily debated all around Europe <a href="#source1">[1]</a>. Proponents of the measures highlighted the fairness of the measure at a time when citizens and companies alike were struggling to pay their bills. However, this kind of market correction raises numerous questions. The first concerns the practical application of these measures. For instance, one may ask, “At what level should profits be considered excessive, and how much should they be taxed?”. Austria answered the first part of this question pragmatically for oil and gas companies by using previous years' profits as a baseline. The level of taxation is, however, completely arbitrary and “based on what is set in most other European countries, such as the Netherlands and France” <a href="#source3">[3]</a>. For electricity companies, the decision is more obscure. Indeed, it is difficult to determine from the government communication how and why the ceilings of 140 and 180€/MWh were set.</p>
<p>The other major drawback of this measure is the market distortions it creates. Setting a taxation level as high as 90% for power companies resolves, in practice, to set a price cap on electricity prices, with all its drawbacks. In particular, marginal price setters like gas-fired power plants risk being ejected from short-term markets, implying a revenue decrease, thus affecting the appeal to invest in such assets. This comes when Austria plans to expand its network of gas-fired power stations <a href="#source4">[4]</a>, which are needed to back up its growing new renewable energies. The relaxation of the measure for companies investing in the energy transition surely takes this analysis into account. Considering, as does the European Union <a href="#source5">[5]</a>, that gas is green energy would alleviate part of the problem. However, with the recent volatility of gas prices (with peaks of up to 700€/MWh <a href="#source6">[6]</a>), nothing ensures that gas-fired electricity production at this price remains viable in the near future.</p>
